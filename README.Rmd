## Overview

<a href="https://rdatatable-community.github.io/The-Raft/posts/2024-08-01-seal_of_approval-dtplyr/"><img src='man/figures/dt-seal.png' align="right" width="200" height="157" alt="data.table seal of approval"/></a>dtplyr provides a [data.table](https://r-datatable.com/) backend for dplyr. The goal of dtplyr is to allow you to write dplyr code that is automatically translated to the equivalent, but usually much faster, data.table code.

See `vignette("translation")` for details of the current translations, and  [table.express](https://github.com/asardaes/table.express) and [rqdatatable](https://github.com/WinVector/rqdatatable/) for related work.

## Installation

You can install from CRAN with:

```R
install.packages("dtplyr")
```

Or try the development version from GitHub with:

```R
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidyverse/dtplyr")
```

## Usage

To use dtplyr, you must at least load dtplyr and dplyr. You may also want to load [data.table](https://r-datatable.com/) so you can access the other goodies that it provides:

```{r setup}
library(data.table)
library(dtplyr)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
```

Then use `lazy_dt()` to create a "lazy" data table that tracks the operations performed on it.

```{r}
mtcars2 <- lazy_dt(mtcars)
```

You can preview the transformation (including the generated data.table code) by printing the result:

```{r}
mtcars2 %>%
  filter(wt < 5) %>%
  mutate(l100k = 235.21 / mpg) %>% # liters / 100 km
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(l100k = mean(l100k))
```

But generally you should reserve this only for debugging, and use `as.data.table()`, `as.data.frame()`, or `as_tibble()` to indicate that you're done with the transformation and want to access the results:

```{r}
mtcars2 %>%
  filter(wt < 5) %>%
  mutate(l100k = 235.21 / mpg) %>% # liters / 100 km
  group_by(cyl) %>%
  summarise(l100k = mean(l100k)) %>%
  as_tibble()
```

## Why is dtplyr slower than data.table?

There are two primary reasons that dtplyr will always be somewhat slower than data.table:

* Each dplyr verb must do some work to convert dplyr syntax to data.table
  syntax. This takes time proportional to the complexity of the input code,
  not the input _data_, so should be a negligible overhead for large datasets.
  [Initial benchmarks][benchmark] suggest that the overhead should be under
  1ms per dplyr call.

* To match dplyr semantics, `mutate()` does not modify in place by default.
  This means that most expressions involving `mutate()` must make a copy
  that would not be necessary if you were using data.table directly.
  (You can opt out of this behaviour in `lazy_dt()` with `immutable = FALSE`).
